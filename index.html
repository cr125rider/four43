						I am a 24 year old software developer based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. I am passionate
						about the open web and the opportunities it brings to communication and business around the
						world. Traditional database and other storage systems are also one of my interests. Combining
						the two with security in the center I help can create products that solve a wide range of 
						problems.

							During my time at Media Logic Group we have created a variety of

							to our success as a flexible small company and designing them has been
							very exciting. We work with a variety of data sources and technologies

						<h3>451 Unavailable - <a class="lead" href="http://www.451unavailable.org/">451unavailable.org</a></h3>
						<p>
							The 451 Unavailable group is encouraging transparency for censorship around the world. They have created a proposal
							for the HTTP 451 Unavailable status code that servers should return if they are unable to return content
							due to censorship. The spec can be found here: <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tbray-http-legally-restricted-status-03'>IETF Legally Restricted Status</a>.
							I am looking to get more involved in an organization role with the group.

						<h3>SleepyTable - <a class="lead" href="https://github.com/hamweather/sleepytable">github.com/hamweather/sleepytable</a></h3>
						<p>
							SleepyTable is an open source project sponsored by Media Logic Group. It was designed to ingest web API's 
							and allow for paging, filtering, and sorting server side. I was able to release the plugin
							as open source and am looking for more developers for the project. It was originally developed as a jQuery plugin
							but I would like to update it with a more modern framework like Bootstrap.

					<li>
						<h3>Real Value</h3>
						<p>
							I like to create software that helps people. Good developers and good software companies create products 
							that have value to real people. Software helps people, keeps them safe, or helps them more efficiently
							create other products to help other people and I want to be a part of it.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Transparency</h3>
						<p>
							Be verbose, open, and truthful. Free speech and the worlds knowledge at our fingertips
							are things I don't take lightly living in the US. Everyone deserves transparency from their
							government, to know full history, and have the ability to openly share thoughts with everyone 
							or only the ones the care about.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Defect</h3>
						<p>
							Innovation never comes from those that follow norms. People who go against the grain find
							opportunities for improvement and new solutions.
