                                An always up to date cache for high throughput applications. Crisp Cache adds "stale" to the
                                lifecycle of a cache element. Stale entries are used from the cache while Crisp Cache fetches
                                new cache entries in the background. Responsive applications need reliable consistent streams
                                of data, and Crisp Cache fills the void over other caches that may block when an entry is expired
                                or goes past it's TTL.

                                Admiral-CLI is a Command Line Framework (CLI) framework for Node.js. There are other CLI
                                frameworks available for Node.js already, however Admiral adds validation and some callbacks
                                in key places to make apps easier to write. We wanted to create a framework with less
                                configuration but stronger validation.

                                Configuration should be easy to understand while CLI parameters are strictly validated
                                and appropriate error messages are passed on to the user. A CLI is a user interface,
                                let's treat it like one.

                                Documentation is always difficult to create and keep up to date. Cite API aims to step in and
                                ease the creation for RESTful APIs. It looks at JSON Schema, the same schema that is tested as
                                correct API input/output and generates beautiful docs based on that. Much like Swagger, but with
                                less configuration, as the configuration is already the tested schema. This project is in the
                                very early stages of development but the need is high for better documentation tools.

                                SleepyTable is an open source project sponsored by AerisWeather. It was designed to ingest web API's
                                and allow for paging, filtering, and sorting server side. It is open source and is looking for more developers for the project. It was originally developed as a
                                jQuery plugin and is a little dated now, but is still used in production. I would like to update it with a more modern framework like Bootstrap possibly React or Angular.
